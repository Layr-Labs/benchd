//! The PER-BOX baseline surface of the ranked paired path (David ruling 2026-09-08).
//!
//! A ranked run of a track whose fixture declares
//! [`bench_core::contract::scores_against_live_control_leg`] measures TWO legs on
//! ONE box in ONE job, on the prompt of each pair's golden:
//!
//! 1. a SERIAL-CONTROL leg on the organizer-staged REFERENCE tree, with no speculation;
//! 2. the CANDIDATE leg on the submission tree, at its declared draft depth.
//!
//! The score is the live ratio of the two. There is NO stored pair: not in the constants, not in
//! the fixture, not in the golden. This module owns everything around that ruling that is not a
//! measurement — the two runner inputs, the per-box calibration file, and every refusal by name:
//!
//! * [`resolve_workspace`] / [`load_calibration`] — the two required inputs, from the flags or the
//!   [`BASELINE_WORKSPACE_ENV`] / [`BASELINE_CALIBRATION_ENV`] environment variables;
//! * [`BaselineCalibration::check_identity`] — the file names THIS track and THIS box, and holds
//!   an entry for the prompt;
//! * [`BaselineCalibration::check_band`] — the control leg's measured seconds-per-token sit inside
//!   the HEALTH BAND around this box's mean for the prompt it measured. The mean comes from the
//!   file; the band comes from the track fixture ([`HealthBand::of_contract`]). The band is a
//!   health gate on leg 1 and NEVER a denominator: no number in the file reaches the score;
//! * [`refuse_golden_with_stored_pair`] / [`refuse_stored_baseline_override`] — a golden carrying
//!   `benchmark.baseline_*_seconds_per_token`, and the `MLXFAST_PAIRED_BASELINE_*` env /
//!   `--baseline-*` flags, are refused on this path because each is a stored denominator.
//!
//! It also owns the AUTHORING half: [`calibration_from_passes`] turns the control legs
//! `benchd calibrate-baseline` measured on each prompt into the file, and refuses by name
//! ([`bench_core::constants::CALIBRATION_CV_EXCEEDED`]) when the box is too noisy for the mean to
//! describe it.
