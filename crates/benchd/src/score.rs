//! Sealed `score.json` payload — a faithful port of the Swift
//! `ScorePayload` / `ScoreMetrics` (Sources/MLXFastCore/Score.swift).
//!
//! Field names, JSON keys, nesting, and null semantics match the Swift Codable
//! types so a benchd-written score parses/diffs against `benchmark.sh --local-iterate`
//! (the M1 / WS1-10 gate). Diagnostic real-valued fields are coarsened to
//! `PUBLIC_DIAGNOSTIC_SIGNIFICANT_FIGURES` (2) sig figs before writing, exactly like
//! Swift `withCoarsenedPublicDiagnostics`; ranking/floor fields stay precise.
//!
//! benchd is the SOLE writer of the score (no discard/reseal), and writes a
//! `.sha256` sidecar of the exact score bytes.
