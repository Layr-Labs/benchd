//! Scoring + golden-schema constants, ported verbatim from the Swift
//! `MLXFastConstants` enum (Sources/MLXFastCore/Constants.swift).
//!
//! This module is the single source of truth for the values that are triplicated
//! across the Swift codebase (MLXFastConstants, benchmark.yml, overlay-paired-timing.sh).
//! Only the scoring + golden-validation subset is ported here (this crate's scope).
//!
//! NOTE: a track scores against a baseline in ONE of two ways, and the two never mix.
//!
//! * A LIVE-CONTROL-LEG track (the fixture's `scores_against_live_control_leg`, read through
//!   [`crate::contract::scores_against_live_control_leg`]) stores NO pair at all. Its ranked run measures a
//!   serial-control leg on the reference tree on the same box, in the same job, and that live
//!   measurement is the denominator (David 2026-09-08, `docs/track-release-branches.md`). The two
//!   Qwen 3.8 125B-A6B tracks are these tracks.
//! * A STORED-PAIR track keeps its pair and its acceptance bands as ONE captured unit
//!   ([`OfficialBaseline`]) in the fixture's own
//!   `official_baseline_{prefill,decode}_seconds_per_token`, read through
//!   [`crate::contract::official_baseline`], which refuses BY NAME for a track that declares
//!   neither ([`OFFICIAL_BASELINE_PENDING`]). Values are carried at full precision to stay bit-identical
//!   with the source they were captured from. The legacy `qwen3.8-27b-mtp-v1` and
//!   `gemma4-26b-a4b-mlx-v1` tracks are these tracks.
//!
//! No number anywhere here is a placeholder: a track with no pair carries no bytes a score could
//! consume.
