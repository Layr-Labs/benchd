//! The `--contract` track fixture and the David 2026-08-26 ARM GATE.
//!
//! Moved out of the retired measure-job (`measure_job.rs`) so the SOLE scored path — flow A,
//! `benchd iterate --mode official` — inherits the arm gate. The struct and the gate behavior
//! are byte-identical to the measure-job originals. This is the ONE typed view of a track
//! fixture: the measure-job used to keep a second, four-field `Contract` of its own and parse the
//! same bytes into both, so a fixture had two schemas that could disagree within one file. serde
//! ignores every other fixture key exactly as before (no `deny_unknown_fields`), so the real track
//! fixtures — which still carry `calibration`, `hidden_correctness_golden`, `reference_model`, …
//! — parse unchanged.
//!
//! A fixture is READ ONCE per run, through [`load`], which digests the bytes it parsed
//! ([`LoadedContract`]). That digest is sealed as `metrics.contract_sha256` — the MIGRATION PIN:
//! the scored artifact records WHICH fixture bytes decided its arm state, its floors and its pair
//! count, the same way `metrics.golden_hash` records which golden bytes it was judged against.
