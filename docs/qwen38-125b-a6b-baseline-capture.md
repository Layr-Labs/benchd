# Qwen 3.8 125B-A6B per-box calibration

This page tells the box agent how to calibrate ONE ranked box for the Qwen 3.8
125B-A6B tracks. One bench tree serves two engines. The track id selects the
platform: `qwen3.8-125b-a6b-mlx-v1` or `qwen3.8-125b-a6b-cuda-v1`.

Do the procedure once for each ranked box. Do it again when the organizer moves
the reference tree. Do not run it on a laptop. Run it on the ranked box only.

## 1. What a ranked run measures

These tracks store NO baseline pair. There is no pair in the track fixture and
no pair in a golden. A ranked run measures its own denominator (David ruling,
2026-09-08).

A ranked run measures the number of PAIRS the track fixture declares in
`official_pairs` — 2 on both platforms (David ruling, 2026-09-09) — on ONE box
in ONE job. The run is given N goldens, and pair k (1-based) measures golden
(k - 1) mod N. Every pair is the same two legs in the same order, on the same
prompt:

1. The SERIAL-CONTROL leg, on the organizer-staged reference tree. No
   speculation.
2. The CANDIDATE leg, on the submission tree, at its declared draft depth.

The two engines are strictly sequential and each leg loads the model once.
benchd sums each role's per-token times over the pairs, and the aggregate is
what the score, the floors and the bands read. Every control leg is band-checked
on its own. The score is the live ratio of those aggregates:

```
(ref_prefill_spt / cand_prefill_spt)^0.25 * (ref_decode_spt / cand_decode_spt)^0.75
```

The speedup floors and the acceptance bands do not change. The band shape is
prefill +5 % up, decode +2 % up. The down bands are DISABLED on both axes: a
control leg faster than its calibration is a well box and passes. What changed
is the reference the shape is applied to. It is a live measurement, not a
stored pair.

Leg 1 runs the reference tree's OWN engine and the reference tree's OWN weights.
benchd finds both by re-rooting the candidate's own root-relative path into the
reference tree, so the two legs differ by their tree and by nothing else. The
transform that writes the weights is participant-editable, so the control leg
never loads the candidate's transform output. When the weights are an
organizer-staged tree outside every checkout, and the reference tree holds no
`weights/` of its own, both legs load that one tree; no participant transform
can reach it.

## 2. What this page calibrates

The calibration file holds the means of a HEALTH BAND for leg 1 only. It says
what a control leg costs on this box when the box is well. A ranked run compares
its measured control leg against that mean, and refuses the run when the leg is
SLOWER than the band's ceiling (`mean * high` on either axis). The track fixture
sets `high`: `1 + prefill_band_up_tolerance` and `1 + decode_band_up_tolerance`.
A fixture that declares no band shape gets 1.05 (prefill) and 1.02 (decode).
This is regression detection only: a slow control leg means the box is not well.
A control leg faster than the calibration passes; the candidate is scored
against that same live leg, so a fast box hands the candidate nothing. The low
bound is not checked. No number in the file is ever a denominator.

Each ranked box carries its own file. A file captured on another box is refused
by name.

## 3. Before you start

1. Stage the REFERENCE tree on the box. It is the track's promoted baseline
   engine commit, built. Record its path. This page calls it
   `$REFERENCE_WORKSPACE`.
2. Build the reference tree's own worker or adapter, at the same path inside the
   tree that a submission builds its own at:
   - MLX: `$REFERENCE_WORKSPACE/.build/release/bench-worker`, staged by that
     tree's `tools/stage-bench-worker.sh`.
   - CUDA: the adapter that tree's `tools/stage-cuda-engine.sh` stages under
     `$REFERENCE_WORKSPACE/.build/release/`.
3. Build benchd from the merged bench branch. Record its commit SHA.
4. Hold the box GPU lock for the whole procedure.
5. Export the track id, the box name and the benchd source commit:

```sh
export MLXFAST_QWEN_MTP_TRACK_ID=qwen3.8-125b-a6b-mlx-v1   # or ...-cuda-v1
export RUNNER_NAME=m5-max-128gb-4-qwen38-125b-a6b-mlx      # this box's runner name
export MLXFAST_BENCHD_SOURCE_COMMIT=<40-hex benchd commit>
```

## 4. Run the calibration

Run this ONCE on the box:

```sh
benchd calibrate-baseline \
  --baseline-workspace "$REFERENCE_WORKSPACE" \
  --engine .build/release/bench-worker \
  --golden "$LIVE_GOLDEN" \
  --passes 4 \
  --out "$REFERENCE_WORKSPACE/baseline-calibration.json"
```

`--weights` defaults to `$REFERENCE_WORKSPACE/weights`, the reference tree's own
transform output. Name another directory only for a track whose weights are an
organizer-staged tree outside every checkout.

`--engine` is a path RELATIVE to the reference workspace root. A ranked run
resolves the reference leg's engine by re-rooting the candidate's own relative
engine path into the reference tree, so the two paths must be the same.

The verb runs the ranked path's own serial-control leg `--passes` times, under
the full official methodology: the quiescence gate and the cool gate before every timed phase, the
unmeasured warm-up leg, the per-platform prefill warm-up count, one resident
worker per pass, and the live golden's own oracle. On CUDA it boots and tears
down the reference tree's resident engine once per pass (see section 7).

It writes the file and refuses by name when the passes are too noisy:

```
CALIBRATION-CV-EXCEEDED
```

A box that refuses is not quiet enough for a mean to describe it. Find out why
before you calibrate again. Do not widen the gate. The maximum is fixed at 1 %
per axis and no flag can relax it.

## 5. The file

`baseline-calibration.json` holds values only:

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "track_id": "qwen3.8-125b-a6b-mlx-v1",
  "box": "m5-max-128gb-4-qwen38-125b-a6b-mlx",
  "reference_commit": "<40 hex>",
  "captured_at": "2026-09-08T00:00:00Z",
  "benchd_source_commit": "<40 hex>",
  "prompts": [
    {
      "prompt": "botany",
      "passes": 4,
      "prefill_seconds_per_token_mean": 0.0006282488193359375,
      "decode_seconds_per_token_mean": 0.0329116748046875,
      "prefill_cv": 0.004,
      "decode_cv": 0.002,
      "prefill_band_low": 0.95,
      "prefill_band_high": 1.05,
      "decode_band_low": 0.98,
      "decode_band_high": 1.02
    }
  ]
}
```

`prompts` holds one entry for each `--golden` the calibration measured.
`calibrate-baseline` takes `--golden` more than once, and writes the entries in
the order given. `box` must equal the runner name the ranked job runs under, and
each golden the ranked run measures must have an entry whose `prompt` equals its
name (the file name minus `.golden.json`). A band describes the leg it was
measured from, so a file captured on another box, or with no entry for a prompt,
is refused. `decode_seconds_per_token_mean` is the mean decode window per token:
decode-run time / N, with no seed prefill in it. Versions 1 and 2 recorded the
whole window (seed prefill plus decode) as decode, so benchd refuses them by name
(`BASELINE-CALIBRATION-WHOLE-WINDOW-DECODE`). Recalibrate the box to write version 3.
The `*_band_low` and `*_band_high` fields record the band of the track fixture
that `calibrate-baseline` was given (`low = 1 - down tolerance`, `high = 1 + up
tolerance`; the values above are the band of a fixture that declares none). The
ranked run does not read these fields. It takes the band from the track fixture
it runs under, so a file written under an earlier band stays valid, and its
means are read as before. The CV fields are fractions: `0.004` is 0.4 %.

The re-rooting that finds the reference tree's engine and weights refuses a
candidate path that walks out of the workspace root with `..`, and refuses a
re-rooted path that resolves outside the reference workspace through a symlink.
The control leg runs the organizer's tree and nothing else.

## 6. Wire the box

A ranked job needs both of these:

| variable | meaning |
|---|---|
| `MLXFAST_BASELINE_WORKSPACE` | the built reference tree on this box |
| `MLXFAST_BASELINE_CALIBRATION` | this box's calibration file |

Both are required on the ranked path. benchd refuses by name when either is
absent or does not match this track and this box. The `--baseline-workspace`,
`--baseline-calibration` and `--box` flags name the same values on the command
line.

Leg 1 is serial, so it verifies its decode tokens against the SERIAL tape. On a
track that ships one oracle tape per draft depth, give leg 1 its own golden with
`--control-golden <PATH>`: pass the serial live golden there and keep the
depth-N golden on `--golden`. With several goldens, give one `--control-golden`
for each `--golden`, in the same order. Pin it with `--control-golden-sha256` and
`--control-golden-bytes`, which work exactly like the `--golden` pin flags: give
both or neither, once for each golden. Without the flag, leg 1 verifies against `--golden`, which is
correct only when the depth-N tape is byte-identical to the serial tape. The
control golden must name the SAME prompt as `--golden`, and a run that measures
no control leg refuses the flag by name. The digest of the golden leg 1 used is
sealed as `metrics.baseline_golden_sha256`.

Leg 2 verifies its timed tokens against `--golden`. By default one different
token fails the run. When the track fixture declares
`timed_token_tolerance_per_thousand` (N), the rule is different:

* Leg 2 does not stop at a different token. It runs its whole decode window, and
  benchd keeps the seed token and the decode tokens it emitted. The timing of the
  leg does not change. The prefill token check and every other check stay.
* A pair whose tokens equal the golden's oracle has 0 mismatches and is not
  replayed.
* After the last pair, benchd boots the reference tree's engine the way leg 1
  boots it, and ONE reference worker replays each other pair's tokens
  teacher-forced: `correctness_begin` on the decode seed, then
  `correctness_step` on each emitted token. A position where the candidate's
  token is not the reference engine's argmax for that prefix is one mismatch. The
  replay is not timed.
* A pair passes when `mismatches * 1000 <= N * tokens`. One pair over the limit
  refuses the whole run as `TIMED-DIVERGENCE-OVER-TOLERANCE`, with the pair, the
  count and the limit. A replay that does not complete refuses the run as
  `TIMED-REPLAY-FAILED`.
* Leg 1 stays exact in every mode: the reference tree must reproduce its own
  golden.

The cost of the rule: with a tolerance, a ranked run does not prove that the
candidate's output is the reference output. It proves that at most N per
thousand of its tokens differ from what the reference engine chooses for the
same prefix.

The fixture selects one of two rules:

* **Plain rule:** `timed_token_tolerance_per_thousand` only. Every different
  token counts against N.
* **Near-tie rule:** `timed_token_tolerance_per_thousand` and
  `timed_token_near_tie_relative_gap` (G, at least 0 and below 1). A different
  token is a NEAR TIE when the candidate's token is the reference engine's second
  choice at that position, and the relative gap
  `(top1 - second) / max(1, |top1|)` between the reference's first and second
  choice there is at most G. Any mismatch that is not a near tie refuses the
  run as `TIMED-DIVERGENCE-NOT-A-NEAR-TIE`, before the count rule and whatever
  the count. The message names the pair, the position, G and the condition
  that failed. Near ties still count against N.

A fixture that declares G without N is refused at parse. The cost of the
near-tie rule: it forgives a change of winner between two tokens that the reference engine scores almost the same, and nothing else.

## 7. The per-leg resident engine (both platforms)

On EITHER platform the model is owned by a RESIDENT process, and that process
belongs to ONE leg's tree:

* CUDA: the worker is a thin adapter over a resident `ds4-resident`.
* MLX: the worker attaches to a resident `bench-worker` that holds the whole
  checkpoint, because an in-process load per phase is unaffordable.

So each leg needs its own resident from its own tree. benchd boots and tears one
down per leg through a fixed convention. The argv contract is IDENTICAL on both
platforms; only the script name differs. Both commands run with the working
directory set to that leg's workspace:

```
<workspace>/<script> --boot --spec <serial|mtp> --draft-len <N> --socket-out <FILE>
<workspace>/<script> --stop --socket <PATH>
```

| platform | script | socket injected as |
|---|---|---|
| MLX | `tools/resident-up.sh` | `BENCH_WORKER_RESIDENT_SOCKET` |
| CUDA | `tools/serve-up.sh` | `DS4_RESIDENT_SOCKET` and `BENCH_WORKER_RESIDENT_SOCKET` |

`--boot` boots exactly one resident, waits until it answers a healthy hello,
writes the resident's Unix-socket path as the first line of `<FILE>`, and exits
0 with the resident still running. `--stop` tears it down and is idempotent: a
resident that is already gone is not an error. Leg 1 is always booted
`--spec serial --draft-len 0`, whatever the submission declares. benchd runs
`--stop` when the leg ends, on success and on failure alike, so the two legs
never hold GPU memory at the same time.

On macOS the Seatbelt profile carries ONE `network-outbound` allowance, naming ONE socket path
literal, because Seatbelt counts an AF_UNIX connect as network. That profile is therefore built
PER SPAWN from THAT leg's socket: the reference leg may reach the reference resident and nothing
else, and the candidate leg may reach the candidate resident and nothing else. The rest of the
profile is unchanged, and its `(allow default)` base means the reference leg reads the reference
tree's own weights and metallib with no extra allowance — the only denied reads are the private
golden and the private dir.

Do NOT wrap benchd in the resident wrapper on the paired path. benchd runs it
itself, twice. A resident socket inherited from benchd's own environment is
refused by name (`LEG-SERVE-INHERITED-SOCKET`): one resident for both legs
prices the candidate against itself on CUDA, and on MLX it does not even reach a
number — the reference leg's worker refuses, because the resident holds the
candidate tree's weights and the leg asked for the reference tree's.

The refusal is scoped to the PAIRED path. The single-resident shapes are
untouched: a LOCAL UNSCORED run has one tree and one leg, so a measure script
that wraps benchd in `tools/resident-up.sh` for it is exactly right, and the
inherited socket is used as before.

## 8. Refusals, by name

| name | meaning |

| `BASELINE-WORKSPACE-NO-WEIGHTS` | the tree holds no weights at the candidate's own relative path |
| `BASELINE-ENGINE-NOT-ROOT-RELATIVE` | the candidate engine is not addressable from the workspace root, or its re-rooted path leaves the reference tree |
| `BASELINE-WEIGHTS-NOT-ROOT-RELATIVE` | the candidate weights' re-rooted path leaves the reference tree |
| `BASELINE-CALIBRATION-MISSING` | no calibration file was named, or it could not be read |

| `LEG-SERVE-BOOT-FAILED` | a leg's resident did not boot |
| `LEG-SERVE-INHERITED-SOCKET` | a resident socket was inherited instead of booted per leg |
| `TIMED-DIVERGENCE-OVER-TOLERANCE` | a pair's candidate tokens differ from the reference engine's choice on more than the fixture's timed token tolerance |
| `TIMED-DIVERGENCE-NOT-A-NEAR-TIE` | under the near-tie rule, a pair's candidate token differs from the reference engine's choice and is not a near tie |
| `TIMED-REPLAY-FAILED` | the reference engine's replay of a pair's candidate tokens did not complete |

## 9. Local runs

A participant iterates locally without a reference tree. `--mode local-iterate`
and `--mode local-submit` therefore keep working on these tracks:

* With NO reference tree named, the run measures the CANDIDATE LEG ONLY and
  seals NO score. It writes the real timings, the real correctness verdict,
  `score: null`, an empty `metrics.error`, and
  `baseline_source: "none (local mode: unscored)"`. The printed summary reports
  the candidate leg in tokens per second. The run is not a failure; it simply
  has no denominator, and a score with no denominator is not a score.
* With BOTH `MLXFAST_BASELINE_WORKSPACE` and `MLXFAST_BASELINE_CALIBRATION`
  present, the local modes run the FULL PAIRED PATH, exactly as ranked: the
  control leg, the band check, the candidate leg, and the live ratio.

Half the inputs is not the paired path. One leg cannot be checked against a band
that is not there, so a run with only one of the two takes the unscored branch.

The unscored branch has no reference tree, so it cannot replay a different
token. It judges every timed token exactly. When the fixture declares a timed
token tolerance, its refusal says that the ranked run tolerates up to N per
thousand and that a local run without a reference tree cannot apply that rule.

## 10. What the run seals

A ranked paired run seals these fields in `score.json` `metrics`:

- `baseline_source` — `serial-control-leg`.
- `baseline_box`, `baseline_calibration_sha256`, `baseline_reference_commit`.
- `baseline_band_passed`.
- `baseline_leg_prefill_seconds_per_token`,
  `baseline_leg_decode_seconds_per_token` — the scored pair's serial-control
  leg, per token. Decode is the decode window over N; the seed prefill is not in
  it. `baseline_leg_decode_window_seconds_per_token` and
  `candidate_leg_decode_window_seconds_per_token` carry the same decode values,
  and `*_leg_seed_prefill_window_seconds_per_token` the seed prefill per seed
  token, report-only.
- `candidate_leg_prefill_seconds_per_token`,
  `candidate_leg_decode_seconds_per_token` — the scored pair's candidate leg,
  per token. The scored pair is the one whose composite is the lower median
  over the pairs. Under `official_pair_combine: "mean"` these four fields are
  the means of the per-pair figures instead.
- `paired_legs` — one row per pair, in order: `pair`,
  `control_prefill_seconds_per_token`, `control_decode_seconds_per_token`,
  `candidate_prefill_seconds_per_token`, `candidate_decode_seconds_per_token`,
  as measured. The track fixture's `official_pairs` sets the row count (2 on
  both platforms, David ruling 2026-09-09). A run that stops early keeps the
  pairs it measured in this list and seals no score. Each row also carries
  `token_mismatch_count` (the candidate tokens that differ from the reference
  engine's choice; 0 when the tokens equal the oracle),
  `token_mismatch_first_step` (the position of the first one, 0 is the seed
  token; null when there is none), and two report-only figures:
  `token_mismatch_second_choice_count` (the mismatches where the candidate's
  token is the reference engine's second choice) and
  `token_mismatch_second_choice_max_relative_gap` (the largest relative gap
  between the reference's first and second choice over those positions). No
  decision reads the two report-only figures. Under the near-tie rule the row
  also carries `token_mismatch_near_tie_count` (the mismatches that are near
  ties; null under the plain rule). No token id is sealed.
- `timed_token_tolerance_per_thousand` and `timed_token_near_tie_relative_gap` —
  the tolerance and the near-tie limit the run applied, when the fixture
  declares them. `token_mismatch_count`, `token_mismatch_first_step`,
  `token_mismatch_near_tie_count`,
  `token_mismatch_second_choice_count` and
  `token_mismatch_second_choice_max_relative_gap` carry the scored pair's values.

- `decode_speedup_floor`, `prefill_speedup_floor` — the two floors this run
  enforced, from the track fixture's `decode_speedup_floor` and
  `prefill_speedup_floor` (0.95 and 0.95, David ruling 2026-09-09). The
  fixture is the only source: a fixture that declares neither refuses the run.
- `passed_decode_speedup_floor`, `passed_prefill_speedup_floor` — whether each
  live speedup reached its own floor. The floor beside each flag is the floor
  the flag was decided against.

`baseline_prefill_seconds_per_token` and `baseline_decode_seconds_per_token`
carry the serial-control mean values, so the board reads them unchanged.
`prefill_speedup`, `decode_speedup` and the score are the live ratios. A run
that misses either floor seals no score.
