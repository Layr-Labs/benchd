# Runbook: a new engine track, from runner to open row

**Class:** runbook. The box runbooks cover the machine: [`box-setup-runbook.md`](box-setup-runbook.md),
[`runbook-box-setup-mlx.md`](runbook-box-setup-mlx.md), [`runbook-box-setup-cuda.md`](runbook-box-setup-cuda.md).
This page covers the track. Do it once per track. A ranked run is paired, and the baseline is per box
(David ruling 2026-09-08).

## 1. A track is four things

| thing | where | what it holds |
|---|---|---|
| a runner | the engine repo's `Runner/<Family>Runner.swift`, an editable copy that registers itself in the fork's `RunnerRegistry` and shadows the fork's built-in runner; the model implementation stays in the fork submodule | the model behind CBv2, and a static manifest: decoders, depth range, regimes |
| an engine repo | `{mlxfast\|cudafast}-{model}{ver}-{params}-engine` | `benchmark.json`, the track fixture, the fork pin, the benchd channel, `benchmark.yml` |
| goldens | `correctness_prompts/<track_id>/` in the engine repo | the timed pool, the live golden, one oracle for each permitted draft depth |
| per-box state | the runner service environment on the box | the track label, the built reference tree, this box's calibration file |

The fixture names the rest: `live_golden` is a scored prompt, `live_golden_speculative` holds
one tape for each depth, `baseline_reference_commit` is the commit the reference tree must sit at,
`official_pairs` is the number of pairs one ranked run measures (2 on both platforms, David ruling
2026-09-09), `decode_speedup_floor` and `prefill_speedup_floor` are the two speedup floors the
scored run must clear (0.95 and 0.95, same ruling), and every golden is pinned there by sha256 and
bytes. No golden holds a baseline pair, and no
fixture or constant holds one either. benchd refuses a golden that carries
`benchmark.baseline_*_seconds_per_token` on the ranked path.

Two names carry the per-box state. `MLXFAST_BASELINE_WORKSPACE` is the built reference tree;
`MLXFAST_BASELINE_CALIBRATION` is this box's `baseline-calibration.json`. `tools/calibrate-box.sh`
writes that file. It runs `benchd calibrate-baseline` for 4 passes on the reference tree for each
prompt, and it refuses to write when the coefficient of variation is above 2 % on either axis. The
file holds one band for each prompt. A band is a health band for the serial-control leg, never a
denominator: a stale file cannot move a score, only stop a
run. benchd itself is built and published from bench `main` to the dist channel. The engine names
the channel only; `tools/fetch-benchd.sh` resolves it and verifies the binary against
`benchd.manifest.json`. A ranked box holds that pair offline in `BENCHD_BIN_DIR`.

Each ranked job measures `official_pairs` pairs on the same box, in the same job, over the goldens
on its command line (one `--golden` for each prompt, N in all). Pair k (1-based) measures golden
(k - 1) mod N, so `official_pairs` must be a multiple of N. Every pair is the same two legs in the
same order, and both legs of a pair measure the same prompt. Leg 1 is the **serial-control leg**, on
the reference tree, with no speculation: benchd verifies its tokens against the serial tape
(`--control-golden`), checks its cost against this box's band for that prompt, and stops the run
when the leg falls outside. Leg 2 is the **candidate leg**, on the submission tree at its declared draft depth,
verified against that depth's tape. One different timed token fails the run, unless the fixture
declares `timed_token_tolerance_per_thousand` (N). With N, the candidate leg runs its whole decode
window, and after the last pair the reference tree's engine replays the candidate's own tokens
teacher-forced. A pair fails when more than N per thousand of its tokens differ from the reference
engine's choice for the same prefix. Leg 1 stays exact. With a tolerance, a ranked run does not
prove that the candidate's output is the reference output; it proves that at most N per thousand of
its tokens differ from what the reference engine chooses for the same prefix. When the fixture also
declares `timed_token_near_tie_relative_gap` (G), only near ties are tolerated: the candidate's
token must be the reference engine's second choice, with a relative gap between the reference's
first and second choice of at most G. Any other different token fails the run, whatever the count.
The cost of the near-tie rule: it forgives a change of winner between two tokens that the reference engine scores almost the same, and nothing else. Each leg boots its own engine and loads the model once. Each
pair has its own composite, `(ref_prefill / cand_prefill)^0.25 * (ref_decode / cand_decode)^0.75`,
from its own control leg. The fixture's `official_pair_combine` sets how the pairs make one score.
Absent or `lower_median`: the run scores the pair whose composite is the lower median over the
pairs (the middle pair on an odd count, the lower of the two central pairs on an even count).
`mean`: the score is the arithmetic mean of the per-pair composites, and the gains and the seconds
per token in `score.json` are the means of the per-pair figures. benchd seals the rule in
`metrics.official_pair_combine`, and seals every pair as measured in `metrics.paired_legs`.

Two gates then apply to each scored pair: the lower-median pair, or every pair under `mean`. The decode speedup must be at or above
`decode_speedup_floor`, and the prefill speedup must be at or above
`prefill_speedup_floor`. Each axis has its own floor, and each floor fails the run on its own.
benchd seals the two floors it used in `metrics.decode_speedup_floor` and
`metrics.prefill_speedup_floor`, so the artifact states the gate it passed.

The fixture is the only source of these three values. A fixture without `official_pairs`, without
`decode_speedup_floor` or without `prefill_speedup_floor` refuses the ranked run. There is no flag,
no environment variable and no default: benchd never guesses a pair count or a floor. `--contract`
is required on every mode, local modes included, so a local run reads the same fixture as a ranked
run. [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) section 6 lists every field the fixture declares.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Y[Yukon row] -- dispatch --> E[engine repo<br/>benchmark.json · fixture · pins]
  E -- "label = track_id" --> B[box<br/>reference tree · calibration · goldens]
  B --> BD["benchd iterate --mode official"]
  BD --> L1[leg 1 · serial control<br/>reference tree · serial tape · band]
  BD --> L2[leg 2 · candidate<br/>submission tree · depth-N tape]
  L1 --> S[score.json · live ratio]
  L2 --> S --> Y
```

Every timed phase of both legs runs behind two gates, in one order: the **quiescence gate** first,
then the **cool gate**. The quiescence gate waits until the box is idle, a 1-minute load average
below 2.0 and a GPU utilization below 0.10, and refuses with `QUIESCENCE-TIMEOUT` after 900
seconds. The cool gate then waits until the GPU is at or below the platform temperature, 40 C on a
Mac and 60 C on a Spark. The same two gates guard every pass of `calibrate-baseline` and the local
modes when the gates are on, and one switch, `MLXFAST_LOCAL_COOL_GATE=0`, turns both off. A ranked
run refuses when a gate finds no reader, so keep `macmon` (Mac) or `nvidia-smi` (Spark) installed
on the box. The score seals every gate point it ran behind, in run order, as `metrics.gates`: one
record per pair, leg and phase, with what both gates read. A calibration file carries the same
records per pass.

## 2. The four steps

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  s1[1 · runner in the fork,<br/>copy in the engine repo] --> s2[2 · engine repo] --> s3[3 · box: label,<br/>reference tree, calibration] --> s4[4 · import, then open]
```

1. **Runner.** Add the runner file to the fork and register its `model_type`, then copy it into the
   engine repo's `Runner/` directory, where the track's `track-bench-worker` registers it ahead of
   the fork's built-in copy. Prove the wire, then merge to fork `main`:

   ```bash
   swift build -c release --product bench-worker
   .build/release/bench-worker manifest --runner <runnerID> --digest
   benchd correctness --manifest <manifest JSON> --engine .build/release/bench-worker \
                      --weights <dir> --golden <public golden JSON>
   ```

2. **Engine repo.** Seed it from the newest engine repo's `main` as one signed commit, then stamp
   the new identity:

   ```bash
   tools/new-track.sh --track-id <track_id> --fork-sha <40 hex> \
                      --checkpoint <hf_repo>@<40 hex> --os macOS
   ```

   The script stamps the names, the fork pin, the benchd channel and the `runs-on` label, and pins
   the checkpoint files. It commits nothing. Review the diff, commit, push.

3. **Box.** Register the runner with the label `self-hosted, <os>, <track_id>`. Record the goldens
   on the box, commit them with their pins, and stage them. Then build the reference tree and
   calibrate:

   ```bash
   tools/stage-baseline-workspace.sh <reference dir>
   export MLXFAST_BASELINE_WORKSPACE=<reference dir>
   tools/calibrate-box.sh "<runner name>" <calibration file>
   export MLXFAST_BASELINE_CALIBRATION=<calibration file>
   tools/ranked-box-preflight.sh
   ```

   Export both names in the runner service environment. The preflight refuses when the tree is not
   at `baseline_reference_commit`, or when the calibration names another track or another box.

4. **Import.** One command imports the branch, waits for the validation run, and opens the row.
   The seed's `mtp-head.manifest.json` declares `spec.enabled: false`, so the validation run
   measures two serial legs and scores near 1.00.

   ```bash
   bun run work/mlx-reimport/import-branch.ts git@github.com:Layr-Labs/<engine>.git \
     --branch main --api https://api-dev.yukon.org --open
   ```

Submissions build on the branch tip, so a trusted-file fix needs no reimport. Never archive an open
row. A depth-N declaration is one edited file: `mtp-head.manifest.json`.

## 3. What still takes hand work

| item | state |
|---|---|
| the reference tree and the calibration file | staged per box by hand. `tools/stage-baseline-workspace.sh` builds the tree, `tools/calibrate-box.sh` writes the band. The ranked job holds no credential, so it only verifies them. |
| model facts for a new family | `tools/new-track.sh` copies the template's layer counts, head widths and expert geometry. Re-author the fixture's `target` block. |
| hosted CI on the MLX engine repos | red. `ci.yml` checks out with `submodules: false`, so `Vendor/mlx-swift-lm` stays empty and each Swift step fails. |
