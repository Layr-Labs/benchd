# Box setup runbook: DGX Spark (CUDA) and Mac (MLX)

**Class:** runbook. Follow it as written.

This document is the overview: what both box types share, the box
calibration, the differences at a glance, and the faults seen in practice. The step-by-step procedure per platform, each with a readiness
checklist, is in its own runbook:

- [`runbook-box-setup-cuda.md`](runbook-box-setup-cuda.md) for a DGX Spark
- [`runbook-box-setup-mlx.md`](runbook-box-setup-mlx.md) for a Mac

The software chain from a runner (in the fork, with the track's editable copy in the engine repo) to a scored Yukon row, done once per
track rather than once per box, is [`runbook-new-engine.md`](runbook-new-engine.md).

## 1. What both box types need

| item | where it comes from | notes |
|---|---|---|
| the benchmarker pair (`benchd`, `record-correctness-golden`) | this repository's dist channel, one directory per platform, resolved by the engine's `tools/fetch-benchd.sh` | the pair is verified against its own `benchd.manifest.json` (sha256, bytes, `target_triple`); while the track is internal the fetch needs `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `BENCHD_DIST_TOKEN` |
| the GPU lock | `/tmp/mtplx-gpu-exclusive.lock`, a regular file taken with `flock` | every GPU user on the box takes it, including calibration and local runs; a box release never waives it |
| the engine checkout | the ranked job checks it out fresh from the submission; an operator checkout is separate | never measure with an operator checkout that has local edits |
| the runner | a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner whose labels include the track id | the label set is what the workflow's `runs-on` selects |
| the box calibration | this box's `baseline-calibration.json`, written by one calibration on the box | see section 2 |
| `git` at `/usr/bin/git` | the platform image: the Command Line Tools on a Mac, the stock Ubuntu image on a DGX Spark | benchd's two fork-point gates spawn that absolute path, so the runner service `PATH` cannot move which git judges a submission; a box without it fails both gates closed |

## 2. Calibration: this box's health band

Both Qwen 3.8 125B-A6B tracks measure their own denominator. A ranked run
measures the pairs the track fixture declares in `official_pairs` — 2 on both
platforms — on this box, in the same job. Every pair is a SERIAL-CONTROL leg on
the organizer-staged reference tree and then a CANDIDATE leg on the submission
tree, and the score is the live ratio of the summed per-token times. No
denominator is pinned anywhere.

What the box needs is its own HEALTH BAND for that control leg. Write it once
per box with:

```sh
benchd calibrate-baseline \
  --baseline-workspace "$REFERENCE_WORKSPACE" \
  --engine .build/release/bench-worker \
  --golden "$LIVE_GOLDEN" \
  --passes 4 \
  --out "$REFERENCE_WORKSPACE/baseline-calibration.json"
```

`--weights` defaults to the reference tree's own transform output
(`$REFERENCE_WORKSPACE/weights`): the control leg must never load the
candidate's, because the transform is participant-editable.

The verb runs the ranked path's own control leg four times, under the full
official methodology, and refuses by name (`CALIBRATION-CV-EXCEEDED`) when the
box is too noisy for the mean to describe it. Repeat it whenever the organizer
moves the reference tree.

The ranked job then names both inputs: `MLXFAST_BASELINE_WORKSPACE` and
`MLXFAST_BASELINE_CALIBRATION`.

See [`qwen38-125b-a6b-baseline-capture.md`](qwen38-125b-a6b-baseline-capture.md)
for the full procedure, and
[`official-baseline-capture.md`](official-baseline-capture.md) for the
stored-pair capture the earlier tracks still use.

## 3. Differences at a glance

| | DGX Spark (CUDA) | Mac (MLX) |
|---|---|---|
| engine | ds4, built in the job (nvcc + cargo) | mlxfast Swift, built by `setup.sh` (Xcode + Metal) |
| model on the box | organizer-staged GGUF snapshot, verified, never fetched by the job | downloaded and verified by `setup.sh` from the organizer mirror |
| MTP head | separate `mtp-*.gguf` beside the shards | embedded in the checkpoint |
| who holds the weights in a window | `ds4-resident`, one connection at a time | `bench-worker resident`, one connection at a time |
| resident boot/stop script | `tools/serve-up.sh --boot` / `--stop` | `tools/resident-up.sh --boot` / `--stop` |
| worker lifecycle (paired ranked run) | benchd boots one resident per leg from that leg's tree; each phase spawns a thin adapter that attaches to it | benchd boots one resident per leg from that leg's tree; each phase spawns a sandboxed `bench-worker` that attaches to it |
| worker lifecycle (local unscored run) | the measure script's own `tools/serve-up.sh` wrap; one attached worker per window | the measure script's own `tools/resident-up.sh` wrap |
| goldens | organizer material in R2; staged on the box by pin | organizer material in R2; staged on the box by pin |
| cool gate | 50 C | 40 C |
| runner supervisor | systemd | LaunchDaemon |
| pair platform | `linux-aarch64` | darwin |

## 4. Faults seen in practice

| symptom | cause | fix |
|---|---|---|
| ranked job fails at "runner environment" with `cargo`/`nvcc` not on PATH | listener started without the toolchain paths | add `PATH` to the runner `.env`, restart through the supervisor |
| runner shows offline, log says a session already exists | a second listener was started by hand | stop the extra listener; let the supervisor's one reconnect |
| preflight refuses an unpinned `*.json` in the pool directory | a non-pool golden placed beside the pool | move it out of `correctness_prompts/<track>/` |
| calibration or a window stalls with the GPU idle and two workers | a second connection waiting on the one-connection resident | one attached worker per phase; on the paired path never wrap benchd in the resident script (benchd boots each leg's resident itself and refuses an inherited socket, `LEG-SERVE-INHERITED-SOCKET`) |
| speculative candidate misses the prefill band while serial passes | the engine re-uploaded the draft head on first use inside the timed prefill | fixed in the engine (ds4 pin 5f36517); keep the head resident from load |
